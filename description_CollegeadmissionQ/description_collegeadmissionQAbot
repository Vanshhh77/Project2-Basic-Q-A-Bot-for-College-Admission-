1. Question and Answer Dictionary:
A meticulously crafted dictionary containing common admission questions paired with informative responses.
  
2. Interactive User Interface:
An interactive session where users can either ask specific questions, choose from a predefined list, or gracefully exit the conversation.
  
3. Dynamic Responses:
Responses dynamically adjust based on user input, with an option to personalize responses by recognizing the user's name.
  
4. Menu of Questions:
Users can choose from a list of predefined questions by typing 'list,' providing a structured and user-friendly experience.
  
5. Context Handling:
The chatbot remembers user context, specifically the user's name, enhancing personalization throughout the conversation.
  
6. Smooth User Interaction:
Engages users in a conversational manner, introducing itself, asking for the user's name, and providing a friendly environment for admission-related inquiries.
  
  7. Error Handling and Guidance:
Robust error handling ensures that if the bot encounters an unrecognized query, it prompts the user to try another question or suggests using 'list' to explore available options.
  
  8. Session Management:
The bot maintains an ongoing interactive session until the user decides to exit. The exit message includes a personalized touch if the user's name is known.
